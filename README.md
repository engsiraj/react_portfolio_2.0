Hi my name is siraj. I'm a passionate full-stack web developer with a knack for transforming ideas into user-friendly and functional web applications. I leverage a powerful tech stack that empowers me to tackle projects from the ground up.

On the front-end, I utilize JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, with TypeScript to craft dynamic and interactive user experiences. This combination allows me to build visually appealing interfaces that are not only beautiful but also a joy to navigate.

For the back-end, I rely on Python frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI to ensure robust and scalable server-side functionality. This empowers me to create secure and efficient applications that can handle complex operations and grow with your needs.
